## 💍 Overview  

**3Design** is a professional-grade **3D CAD solution** developed by **Type3 (Vision Numeric)** and tailored for jewelry, accessories, and industrial design. It merges artistic freedom with engineering-level precision, empowering designers to create complex, customizable, and production-ready models.  

Built on a **parametric modeling engine**, 3Design gives users the flexibility to alter dimensions, materials, and forms at any point in the workflow. This non-destructive approach makes it ideal for iterative design, allowing artists to refine and experiment without losing work progress.  

The software comes equipped with specialized tools for **gem placement, metal shaping, engraving, and texturing**, along with a powerful **DeepImage™ rendering module** for photorealistic previews. Its high-fidelity visualization engine enables designers to showcase their creations exactly as they’ll appear in real materials.  

Combining precision, versatility, and creative control, **3Design** has become a trusted standard in professional jewelry workshops and product design studios worldwide.
